Homework #2 __Due Tuesday, May 30th, at 11PM__ 


* we'll do go over potential solutions to multiply together!
* for the remainder of the homework
    * write your own code
    * (though, I expect that multiply will be the same one that we mostly implement in class)

1. [multiply.py](homework/hw02/multiply.py) (partially implemented in class together!)
2. [grade_bot_3000.py](homework/hw02/grade_bot_3000.py)
3. [change_puhleese.py](homework/hw02/change_puhleese.py)
