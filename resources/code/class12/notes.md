Use PyCharm because:

1. more / better features than IDLE
    * better debugger (step through code line-by-line)
        * set breakpoints
    * autocomplete is better, more refactoring tools, etc.
2. pycharm manages all of the downloaded modules for you
    * (otherwise you'd have to use the commandline)
    * there are problem domains that are not included in stock python
    * web development
    * scientific computing
    * numerical computation
    * nlp
    * image processing
    * instead we'll download these modules
