5% <-- from small project... fold into homework grade

1 hw today python + postgres (hw6)
maybe one more hw

drop one homework, lowest grade

2nd exam:

* mostly after midterm material
* you'll still have to know sql and python

pandas quiz <-- yet to reopen

prior to exam, in-class
tutor can hold out of class review... q's beforehand
exam is on the 12

if you do 10% better on the final than on the midterm
shift weights.. maybe to 15 and 50

boundaries for a C will likely be lowered to accommodate clustering
