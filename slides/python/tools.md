## Using Python to Work with Data

The __first part of this semester__ will focus on:

1. {:.fragment} intermediate Python skillz
2. {:.fragment} using Python to:
	* {:.fragment} read / retrieve and clean data
	* {:.fragment} analyze and / or visualize data

All of this <span class="hl">without a database or SQL</span> (at least not yet!).
{:.fragment}

(we'll get to that in a month or so) üìÖ
{:.fragment}

Many <span class="hl">readings</span> for for this part of the semester will come from <span class="hl">{{site.vars.book1}}</span>
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Why Python?

There are <span class="hl">so many languages for scientific / numeric computing and working with data</span>... &rarr;

* {:.fragment} [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* {:.fragment} [R](https://www.r-project.org)
* {:.fragment} [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)

__‚ùìüêç over these other languages?__
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## ‚ùìüêç  Continued...

__We'll use Python and its ecosystem of data related modules because__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} it's _really_ popular ([like top 3 popular](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) üìà)
* {:.fragment} has a [thriving data science / engineering community](https://pydata.org/) ü§ìü§ìü§ì
* {:.fragment} `pandas`, `jupyter-notebook`, etc. are pretty standard tools to use in your data stack üêº
* {:.fragment} it's a general purpose language that's been widely adopted in other domains, like web applications, dev ops, etc.
* {:.fragment} you probably know basic python already (more time to focus on data related topics) üî¨
* {:.fragment} oh, and I actually _know_ Python a little bit; at least enough to teach it! üôÉ

## Setting up a Dev Environment

__When preparing your computer to develop with _some stack_ of technologies__, what will you need to install? &rarr;

1. {:.fragment} obvs a programming language!
2. {:.fragment} some libraries (in _that_ language)
3. {:.fragment} other system level dependencies (that the language or libraries depend on)
4. {:.fragment} an editor
5. {:.fragment} _ideally_: 
	* {:.fragment} a <span class="hl">package manager </span>
	* {:.fragment} maybe even a <span class="hl">version manager for your language</span>
	* {:.fragment} some mechanism for <span class="hl">isolating installed packages and versions of your language</span>

PLZ EXPLAIN
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Isolating Packages / Language Versions

__You'll probably want a way to make sure that you can create multiple isolated _environments_ to work in__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} that is, a specific version of Python
* {:.fragment} some libraries / modules / packages
* {:.fragment} on a <span class="hl">per-application basis</span>

__Why ‚ÅâÔ∏è__
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} each <span class="hl">application may depend on a different </span> set / version of dependencies / actual language!
* {:.fragment} you may want to be able to update versions for some projects / applications, but not all!
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## A Python Development Environment

__There are many ways to set up a Python dev environment.__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} you're free to do this <span class="hl">any way you like</span>
* {:.fragment} however, I'd recommend using [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/) if this is your first experience with Python package / dependency management
* {:.fragment} some alternatives include:
	* {:.fragment} `pyenv` for managing python versions
	* {:.fragment} `easy_install`, `pip` for installing dependencies (package management)
	* {:.fragment} `virtualenv` for creating isolated sets of dependencies
	* {:.fragment} `pipenv` for all of the above

</section>


<section markdown="block">
## But Why Anaconda?

__Anaconda__ is _kind of like getting everything_, by installing just one thing &rarr;

* {:.fragment} it comes with a commandline tool called `conda`, that allows:
	* {:.fragment} installing multiple versions of Python
	* {:.fragment} installing Python packages
	* {:.fragment} installing non-Python software too (‚ÅâÔ∏è)
	* {:.fragment} creation of isolated environments (language version plus packages)
* {:.fragment} ... the _full_ install also comes with:
	* {:.fragment} an IDE called Spyder (recommended üëç!)
	* {:.fragment} ...and a bunch of pre-installed packages

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Why Not Anaconda?

__You may occasionally see me use a combination of `pip` and `virtualenv` or maybe just `pipenv`__ ... &rarr;

* {:.fragment} `pip` and `virtualenv` are pretty standard, especially when using Python for web development
	* {:.fragment} Anaconda (and `conda`) is usually used heavily in the Python and data community, but not so much outside of that domain
* {:.fragment} ...and there's usually __less friction when you just use one or the other, rather than mixing the two__
	* {:.fragment} (note that you can and sometimes _have to_ use `pip` to install some things rather than `conda`, but best to fall back on that method rather than use it first)

Since my background is firmly in web development, my default setup is using `pip` and `virtualenv`.
{:.fragment}

<section markdown="block">
## Using `conda` to Create Environments

__A quick reference for creating environments once Anaconda is installed__ (and `conda` is available):

1. {:.fragment} `conda list` - list all _linked_ (installed) packages in an environment (you can run this to test if your initial Anaconda installation works ...)
2. {:.fragment} `conda create --name name_yr_env_here python=3` - create a new environment with python 3.x as the version of python (note that there's a base environment that you start with, but to add more, use `create`)
3. {:.fragment} `source activate name_yr_env_here` - _switch_ to your new environment (do a `list` to see the change in packages!)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## `conda` Continued

4. {:.fragment} `source deactivate name_yr_env_here` - _switch_ out of environment
5. {:.fragment} `conda info` and `conda info --envs` - to show info about the current environment or to show available environments 
6. {:.fragment} `conda install some_package_name` - install some_package_name in current environment
7. {:.fragment} (fall back on `pip install some_package_name` if necessary)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Demo

Let's try using Anaconda / conda to:

1. {:.fragment} create and activate an environment
2. {:.fragment} install `django`
3. {:.fragment} install `python-twitter`
4. {:.fragment} see what `pillow` installs (even though it already comes in _base_)
