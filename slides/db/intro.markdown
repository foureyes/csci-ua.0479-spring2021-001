## ‚ö†Ô∏è Mostly True, But Also Not

__Just a warning: There are some generalizations about databases coming up ahead:__ &rarr;

These generalizations hold true for _a lot_ of the databases you'll encounter, but:


* {:.fragment} there are likely databases out there that are outside of these generalizations
* {:.fragment} existing databases have lesser known features that share the same functionality as other competing databases 
* {:.fragment} although Postgres is known as a relational database...
	* {:.fragment} like MongoDB, you can use it to store JSON documents (really Binary JSON - _JSONB_) documents
	* {:.fragment} like Redis, you can use it to store key/value pairs
	* {:.fragment} (MongoDB and Redis have many other features that differentiate them from Postgres)

## Where Does Your Data Live? üè†

So far, as we've been working with data in class and in our homework, __where was our data stored__? &rarr;

* {:.fragment} on the file system as `.csv`s, `.txt` files, etc.)
* {:.fragment} and I suppose, technically, on _someone else's_ file system (like say, a website)

<br>
__What are some downsides to storing data in `.csv`s, `.txt` files or even `.html` (üòÆ)?__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} it's difficult to manipulate that data <span class="fragment">unless you use another tool, like `DataFrame`</span>
* {:.fragment} if you're using `pandas` and reading a file in-memory as a `DataFrame`, what other problems might you encounter?
* {:.fragment} you're gonna run out of memory ü§∑
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Storing Data

__OK, so no more storing files on the file system. What are some other options for storing data?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} obvs, in a <span class="hl">database</span>
* {:.fragment} also, <span class="hl">in the cloud</span>
	* PostgreSQL on Amazon RDS, MongoDB on MongoDB Atlas (basically, on demand database servers running on someone else's resources)
	* firebase, s3, Google Cloud Storage (a mix of different types of "cloud native" data stores)

__Enough `.csv` files__ We'll be using a database now! <span class="fragment">__But wait!__ ü§ö</span>
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} what's a database? 
* {:.fragment} and where does _it_ store its data? 
* {:.fragment} and what _environment_ does it live in?
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## A Database

__A <span class="hl">database</span> is... <span class="fragment">a repository or _organized_ collection of data</span>__ &rarr;

Uh. That could be _anything_. A bunch of post-it notes on my desk. Or directories and files on my laptop (not that different from csvs, amirite)? ü§î
{:.fragment}

However, the term <span class="hl">database</span> also typically refers to _how_ that data is accessed, manipulated or _managed_. &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} when we think of a database, we typically think of an electronic system that... 
* {:.fragment}<span class="hl">abstracts away how the data is physically stored on disk</span>
* {:.fragment} as a database user, we don't have to worry about files; instead, we work with things like:
	* {:.fragment} an interactive graphical representation of data
	* {:.fragment} a query language with commands issued through an interactive shell

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## DBMS

__Access to data in a database is mediated by a <span class="hl">Database Management System</span> (DBMS).__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} a __DBMS__ is software that gives users and applications the ability to __define, create, query and administer a database__
* {:.fragment} it translates requests for data manipulation between the clients and the database itself
* {:.fragment} (it sits between the application accessing the data and the database)
* {:.fragment} data is usually stored in a __DBMS specific format on the file system__ (though this could vary based on the DBMS... for example, in memory only)


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Database vs DBMS

__Despite formal definitions, the term <span class="hl">database</span> (or database server) is often used to refer to both__ &rarr; 

* {:.fragment} a database (an organized collection of data) or multiple databases 
* {:.fragment} ...and the DBMS (software for managing / allowing access to _that_ collection of data).

‚ö†Ô∏è<span class="hl">This implies then that a DBMS can have __multiple databases__ (it can manage multiple collections of data)</span>
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## DBMS Functionality

__A DBMS typically has the following features__ &rarr;

1. {:.fragment} some mechanism for <span class="hl">creating a database</span> and providing structure to the database 
2. {:.fragment} a way to __create__, __read__, __update__ and __delete__ data
3. {:.fragment} <span class="hl">access control</span> (some method of managing access, such as authentication and/or authorization) 
4. {:.fragment} <span class="hl">administration</span> (performance monitoring, logging, resource management, etc.)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Client / Server

__The databases that we'll discuss in this part of the course fit under the client/server model__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} access to the database is through a service
* {:.fragment} the service is provided by a <span class="hl">server</span>:
	1. {:.fragment} a single, centralized server
	2. {:.fragment} a cluster of servers in the same physical location (and perhaps on the same computer)
	3. {:.fragment} several distributed servers in different physical locations
* {:.fragment} the computer requesting the provided services is called the <span class="hl">client</span>
	* {:.fragment} the client and server can be on the same computer, which is how we'll mostly be working with databases: everything on the same machine

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Client / Server Continued

__This client/server architecture implies that:__ &rarr;

* the <span class="hl">server must be "on"</span> (for example, a long running process waiting for requests) in order for data to be accessed
* different clients may exist for accessing the server
	* {:.fragment} a commandline client
	* {:.fragment} a graphical client
	* {:.fragment} a client library used within some _other_ application

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Security


__Database security encompasses working with__ &rarr;


1. {:.fragment} the facilities provided by the database for access control and encryption
2. {:.fragment} the computer(s) that the database server runs on
3. {:.fragment} the network(s) that the database server runs on

We'll mostly consider first item, as the last two are large topics on their own (each with the potential of being a separate course)!
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Regulated Environments, Handling Data

__There are special security requirements when working within a regulated environment, such as health, finance, and education.  A few examples include__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} <span class="hl">PCI DSS</span> (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) 
	* a security standard for handling credit card data and transactions 
	* aimed at reducing credit card fraud
* {:.fragment} <span class="hl">HIPAA</span> (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
	* legislation that governs the handling of medical records and personally identifiable information
	* ensures privacy of medical records
* {:.fragment} <span class="hl">FERPA</span> Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act: 
	* legislation that governs access to educational information

## BACK 2 DATABASES

There are so many of them. [Check out this ranking of databases on db-engines.com](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking)...

Sooo many databases! Literally 100's. __Let's see how wen categorize these databases__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

__We can categorize databases as:__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} relational
* {:.fragment} object
* {:.fragment} nosql (also _non-relational_ ... or _not only SQL_ ... or _Not SQL_)
* {:.fragment} hybrids of the above!

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## More NoSQL

__So, NoSQL, is kind of a catch all term for anything that's not-relational, but there can be a ton of these!__

__NoSQL databases can be further categorized by the data model they use:__ &rarr;
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} key-value
* {:.fragment} document
* {:.fragment} column
* {:.fragment} graph
* {:.fragment} triple/quad store (RDF) 

[See the wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL#Types_and_examples_of_NoSQL_databases)
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Relational Databases

__Relational databases__ organize data in a collection of tables (relations).  __You can probably describe characterstics of a relational database because we've already worked with tabular data!__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} each table has named <span class="hl">columns</span>... with the actual data that populates the table in separate <span class="hl">rows</span>
* {:.fragment} rows are sometimes referred to as <span class="hl">records</span> or <span class="hl">tuples</span>
* {:.fragment} each table represents a kind or _type_ of _record_ or _tuple_, with every row representing an _instance_ of that kind of record



</section>


<section markdown="block">
## Relations, Rows, and Keys

__Eeach table row has <span class="hl">primary key</span> that:__

* {:.fragment} uniquely identifies that row 
* {:.fragment} rows in one table can be _related_ to rows in other tables by:
	* adding a column that contains the _other_ table's primary key
	* this column is called <span class="hl">foreign key</span>
	
Using this pattern, complex data relationships can be modelled using primary keys and foreign keys.
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Relational Databases Stereotypes

__Because relational databases are usually used to model relationships between _entities_ ...__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} relational databases are typically pretty rigid:
* {:.fragment} they're highly structured
* {:.fragment} columns and types of columns must be defined prior to inserting rows
* {:.fragment} many relational database features deal with maintaining  _data integrity_ (such user defined data constraints, foreign keys, etc.)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
##  Transactions

__A <span class="hl">transaction</span> is a single logical operation or unit of work in a DBMS__ 
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} this unit of work can be composed of multiple create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD)
* {:.fragment} for example, a single transaction may:
	1. {:.fragment} read a value from one record in one table
	2. {:.fragment} then update another record in another table using the value that was previously read



</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Transactions Continued

__In order for a database to:__
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} be <span class="hl">consistent</span> / recover correctly from a crash or failure (fault tolerant)
* {:.fragment} maintain <span class="hl">isolation</span> between concurrent accesses to the database
* {:.fragment} transactions must be: <span class="fragment"><span class="hl">atomic</span>, <span class="hl">consistent</span>, <span class="hl">isolated</span>, and <span class="hl">durable</span></span> 

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## ACID ‚öóÔ∏èüòÆ

__These properties of a transaction - atomicity, consistency, isolation and durability - are sometimes collectively referred to as <span class="hl">ACID</span>__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} __Atomicity__ - each _transaction_ / (series of operations in a transaction) is all or nothing 
* {:.fragment} __Consistency__ - every _transaction_ ensures that the resulting database state is valid (goes from one valid state to another)
* {:.fragment} __Isolation__ - a failed _transaction_ should have no effect on other transactions (even if the transactions are concurrent)
* {:.fragment} __Durability__ - once a _transaction_ / operation is done, the results will remain persistent even through crash, power loss, etc.

See [the ACID article on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) for more details
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## SQL

__To query (read, update, etc.) and maintain a relational database, a domain specific language called <span class="hl">SQL</span> is used.__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} it's a <span class="hl">declarative programming language </span>
	* your program describes _what_ you want
	* rather than _how_ you want to achieve it
	* (describe the outcome rather than the algorithm)
* {:.fragment} __SQL has been standardized__ by The American National Standard Institute (ANSI) and the International Standard Organization (ISO)
* {:.fragment} despite the standardization, there are still __many dialects of SQL specific to the database platform being used__ (and are consequently _non portable_)
* {:.fragment} SQL's theoretical foundation is [relational algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra) (which we'll discuss later in this course)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Declarative Programming

__Remember, <span class="hl">SQL is declarative</span>, so it describes what you want the outcome of your program to be, not how to get to the outcome__ &rarr;
```
# we're describing _how_ in this Python code
oldies = []
for user in users:
	if user.birthday > '1990-01-01':
		oldies.append(user)
```
{:.fragment}

```
--we're explaining _what_ in this SQL query
SELECT first, last 
	FROM user 
	WHERE birthday > '1990-01-01';
```
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Quick Demo of Designing a Data Model for a Relational Database

Maybe we want to store these fields (we'll discuss this in more detail in a later class):

* first name
* last name
* street address
* city
* state
* zip

<br>
__Let's get to it!__ &rarr;

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Examples of Relational Databases

__What are some examples of relational databases?__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} MySQL / MariaDB
* {:.fragment} PostgreSQL
* {:.fragment} Oracle
* {:.fragment} Microsoft SQL Server

<br>
These are all great choices for storing highly structured data, related data.
{:.fragment}

For our purposes (small to medium sized data sets, basic queries and data analysis), there is not much difference among these databases with the exception of perhaps platform, terms of use, and _cost_ 
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Object Databases

__Of course, tables aren't the only way to organize data__ &rarr;

With the popularity of _object-oriented programming_ in the 80's and 90's, databases began to represent information in the form of objects... and they supported features such as:
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} the ability to declare custom types
* {:.fragment} inheritance
* {:.fragment} object versioning support (you'll see this in NoSQL document stores as well)
* {:.fragment} relationships through pointers and the ability to retrieve _all_ the data about an object in a single query

In addition to object databases, hybrid object-relational databases sprang up as well
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## NoSQL Databases

__NoSQL__ databases can be categorized by how they store their data:

* key-value
* document
* column
* graph
* triple/rdf store
* there are others 
	* (such as object, tuple store, etc.)
	* [check out a whole list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL#Types_and_examples_of_NoSQL_databases)
* note that nosql databases _can_ have reliable transactions as well, but this is usually not the focus of a nosql database

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Key Value Store

Probably the most simple conceptually... data is stored in key/value pairs. __This should sound similar to some data structures that you've seen before.__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} maybe a hash
* {:.fragment} or a dictionary
* {:.fragment} or an associative array

<br>
They're typically good at scaling to handle large amounts of data and dealing with high volumes of changes in data.
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Key Value Store Examples

Some key value databases include:

* HBase (key value and columnar, distributed, large data sets)
* Redis (a popular backend for queuing)
* Memcache (as the name implies, typically used for caching)
* Riak
* [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key-value_database#KV_-_eventually_consistent)
</section>


<section markdown="block">
## Document Stores

As you might guess by the name, __document stores__ organize data semi-structured documents. 

* think JSON (but there are many possible formats, such as XML, YAML, etc.)
* or... a _richer_ key-value store (there's _meta data_ within the document... the keys are usually meaningful)
* typically, no schema is required (that is, data types of values are inferred from values)
* typically, semi structured (documents, property names, etc... do not have to be pre-defined)
* some document stores are particularly featureful when it comes to high availability and scaling (through replication/redundancy and sharding/separating large databases into smaller ones)

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Document Stores Continued

__Document stores are particularly good for applications where flexible data storage or constantly changing data storage is required.__

Two of the most popular NoSQL document stores are:
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} CouchDB
* {:.fragment} MongoDB

<br>
Of course, there are a [bunch of others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database#Implementations)
{:.fragment}



</section>
<section markdown="block">
## Document Stores Use Cases

__Some use cases for document stores include:__

* applications that require semi structured data / data that does not have rigid requirements (perhaps a resume)
* again, large volumes of data
* _fluid_ data or data whose structure is prone to change

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Graph Databases

__In a <span class="hl">Graph Database</span>__:

* data is stored as nodes and edges of a graph
* edges represent relationships that directly link items in the database
* useful for modelling complex hierarchical relationships, networks, or any data set that fits into a graph-like structure
* ex. [Neo4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo4j), and [Neo4j use cases](https://neo4j.com/use-cases/)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## NewSQL

__Uh, yes, really. NewSQL__

* relational databases that...
* provide same scalability as NoSQL databases
* and ACID guarantees of relational databases

Examples: Google Spanner, Apache Ignite
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Postgres

__We'll be using PostgreSQL (also called postgres):__ &rarr;

* {:.fragment} it's a hybrid _object-relational_ database
* {:.fragment} it's _open source_ 
* {:.fragment} it's _up there_ in terms of [relational database rankings](https://db-engines.com/en/ranking)

Um, why?
{:.fragment}

__Mainly because of wide support in the Python community (not necessarily for data analysis, but for other libraries)__
{:.fragment}

Again... you'll find very few differences between mysql and postgres for the work that we do, and as new versions of each are released, they usually catch up in terms of features and performance.
{:.fragment}


</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Relational Database / RDBMS vs Pandas? üêº

__Let's discuss__ &rarr;

Not really the same at all!
{:.fragment}

* {:.fragment} a service!
* {:.fragment} multi-client / concurrent access
* {:.fragment} authentication and authorization / role based access
* {:.fragment} transactions
* {:.fragment} ACID compliance
* {:.fragment} replication, logging, clustering, etc.
