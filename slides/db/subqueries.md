## Queryception

Yes. __U can have queries within queries__ ðŸ¤¯: &rarr;

* {:.fragment} the inner queries are called __subqueries__
* {:.fragment} subqueries are nested within another query, the main or outer query
* {:.fragment} subqueries are surrounded by parentheses `()` (and in some cases require an alias)
* {:.fragment} there can be more than one level of nesting (in practice, you'll likely only have one or two levels of subqueries)
* {:.fragment} __subqueries are executed first__; their results are passed along for use by the outer query
* {:.fragment} a subquery can result in:
	1. {:.fragment} a single value
	2. {:.fragment} a row or rows (can essentially be treated as another table!)

## Data Source for Examples

Again, we'll use the _adverse_ food events data: [CAERS](https://www.fda.gov/food/compliance-enforcement-food/cfsan-adverse-event-reporting-system-caers) ...for most of our examples

1. these slides use the 2014-2019 reports
2. [documentation of fields](https://www.fda.gov/media/97035/download)
3. sample data:

* {:.header} Report ID, CAERS Created Date, Date of Event, Product Type, Product, Product Code, Description, Patient Age, Age Units, Sex, MedDRA Preferred Terms, Outcomes
* 172940, 1/1/2014, , SUSPECT, DANNON DANNON LITE & FIT GREEK YOGURT CHERRY, 09,  Milk/Butter/Dried Milk Prod, , , , NAUSEA, Other Outcome
* 175277, 4/7/2014, 3/15/2013, SUSPECT, CHIA PLUS COCONUT CHIA GRANOLA, 05,  Cereal Prep/Breakfast Food, 15, year(s), F, BURNING SENSATION, Other Outcome

## A Problem With Aggregate Functions

Let's __find the event date, reported date, product, and terms of the event that had the longest time between actual occurrence and reporting__ &rarr;

We can find max
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select max(created_date - event_date) from caers_event;
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

But we can't add the other fields (why?), so what do we do?
{:.fragment}

Add a second query I guess ðŸ¤·
{:.fragment}

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select created_date, event_date, product, terms
from caers_event
where created_date - event_date = 23446;
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## A Subquery as a Single Value

__We can simplify this series of queries by using a subquery! Our subquery will return a single value for use in our `WHERE` clause...__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select created_date, event_date, product, terms
from caers_event
where (created_date - event_date) =
      (select max(created_date - event_date) from caers_event);
</code></pre>
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Another Quick Example

We can use single value subqueries in the `SELECT` list as well. 

__Let's try to compare the counts of non-null `created_date` to non-null `event_date` in a query with subqueries__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select
       (select count(*) from caers_event where created_date is not null) as created_count,
       (select count(*) from caers_event where event_date is not null) as event_count;
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}
</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Subqueries as Tables

We'll use the following question to motivate our use of a subquery as a table:

__What are all of the products' names and the year of the event involving them... in the year with the most events reported?__ &rarr;

</section>

<section markdown="block">
## Start with an Aggregate Report


First, lets see the counts by year (of `event_date`)... &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select date_part('year', event_date) as year, count(*) as c
from caers_event
group by date_part('year', event_date)
having date_part('year', event_date) is not null
order by c desc;
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

<section markdown="block">
## Subqueries as a Table!

We can _see_ ðŸ‘€ the max year here... but if we want to use that as a variable value in an expression, one option we have is using a subquery.  (nested aggregate functions are not allowed)

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select max(c) from
(select date_part('year', event_date) as year, count(*) as c
from caers_event
group by date_part('year', event_date)
having date_part('year', event_date) is not null
order by c desc) as year_counts;
</code></pre> 
{:.fragment}

Note that when using a subquery as a table, you must alias is with `AS`.

<section markdown="block">
## Common Table Expression

Alternatively, you can use a __common table expression__ (CTE) to make a temporary table. Use `WITH table_name(column_list) AS query` query to create a CTE:

* the `table_name` and `column_list` specify the table and columns you can use to query the CTE
* the `query` part populates the temporary table and columns
* it's essentially a subquery as a table
	* typically used for _maybe_ nicer syntax
	* (though, apparently, CTEs have some features that subqueries don't, such as being able to refer to itself recursively)
* the CTE only exists for the execution of your _actual_ query, which appears after the CTE itself

## Rewriting the Subquery as a CTE


`year_counts` is a table with two columns, `y` and `c` &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
WITH 
    year_counts(y, c)
AS (
    select date_part('year', event_date) as year, count(*) as c
    from caers_event
    group by date_part('year', event_date)
    having date_part('year', event_date) is not null
    order by c desc
)
select max(c) from year_counts;
</code></pre>
{:.fragment}

## With Limit

__Of course, this is all contrived; a limit and a select list would have worked too (and we can use that in a subquery to get our desired result)__ &rarr;
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
select product,  date_part('year', event_date) as year
from caers_event
where date_part('year', event_date) =
(select date_part('year', event_date) as year
 from caers_event
 group by date_part('year', event_date)
 having date_part('year', event_date) is not null
 order by count(*) desc
limit 1);

## Subquery in Insert

__It's also possible to use a subquery in an insert statement... using the results of the query to fill another table__ &rarr;

<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
insert into table_name (col_name_1, col_name_2)
(select a, b from other_table);
</code></pre>
