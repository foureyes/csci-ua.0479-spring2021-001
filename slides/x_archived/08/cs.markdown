###  Hi. So I'm Teaching a Bunch of Courses Next Semester


Check out the list of [Spring 2016 Courses](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/spring2016/Undergraduate/courses)

If you want to continue working with Python (or if you're considering a web programming minor)...

* you can take a look at my [0380 - topics of general interest, Python for Applications](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/CSCI-UA.0380-004/)
* I can potentially waive the 0004 (html/css) requirements if you have some experience with it... or if you place out of it by taking an exam

###  Considering Becoming a CS Major or Minor?

Take a look at... the requirements for [majors](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/majors) and [minors](http://cs.nyu.edu/webapps/content/academic/undergrad/minors)

If you want to eventually go into the CS major or CS minor

* there are many sections of 101
* if you _really_ want to continue having me talk to you about cats and pizza, you can take my section of [0101 - Intro to Computer Science](http://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring16/CSCI-UA.0101-004/)
* it's _more challenging_ than this course, so even if you get a C to allow you to continue with CS courses, you'll likely need to study during break
