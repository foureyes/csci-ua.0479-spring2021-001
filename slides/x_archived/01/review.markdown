###  Programs and Programming Languages

 __What's a program?__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">

A sequence of instructions that specifies to a computer actions and computations to be performed

__How are programming languages similar to or different from natural languages?__

1. natural languages evolved organically, while programming languages are deliberately created and designed
2. programming languages are usually unambiguous in meaning; on the other hand, there is usually room for interpretation in natural languages

###  More About Programming Languages!

__What does a compiler do?__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">

It translates a high-level programming language into a low-level language that the computer can execute (our books call this object code)

__What's the difference between compiled and interpreted languages?__

Languages that have an explicit compilation step are generally thought of as compiled languages.  That is, the workflow for a compiled language is: write code, compile, execute... rather than just write code and then execute.

###  Tools

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">

Python

__Is python a high level or low level language?  Why?__

* it's meant to be easy to read and write for humans
* abstracts away the details of dealing with the underlying machine

###  Tools Continued

__What extension is used for Python source code files?__

<div class="incremental" markdown="block">

.py

__What kind of applications do we use to create and edit Python programs?__

Text editors and / or IDE's.  We're using IDLE as our IDE

__What's the main difference between using a text editor and the interactive shell to execute code?__

The interactive shell executes code as you enter each line; it give you immediate feedback.  For a text editor, you have to save your entire program first before you can run it.
