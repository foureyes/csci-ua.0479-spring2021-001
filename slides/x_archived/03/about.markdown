	* homework
	* tutors
	* labs
	* using IDLE
* __idioms and style__

</section>

<section markdown="block">
###  Homework

* [homework is due on Thursday, February 5th at 11PM](../../schedule.html#homework1)
* turn in homework (all files) via NYU Classes
* make sure to write your code outside of the comments for the __coding exercises__!
* remember: __work in the text editor__, not the shell/console
* (you'd don't need to turn in your program's output, just your program)
* to turn in your homework, use the original files, and __add your code beneath the comments__
</section>

###  IDLE

* IDLE is bundled with Python 3.4
* it is automatically installed when you install Python
* if you're having stability issues with IDLE on OSX
	* check out the [resources page (under the section called "troubleshooting IDLE")](../../resources.html#IDLE) 
	* as a last resort, try an [alternate editor](../../resources.html#alternate)
</section>

###  Tutors

* tutors will be available to help you with your work (for free!)
	* the schedule should be posted by the end of this week
	* the tutors will be at the labs on [14 Washington place](http://www.nyu.edu/its/labs/wash/)
	* or via email - csciua02 [-at-] gmail.com
* the tutors are incredibly helpful, and I highly suggest going if you're stuck on a problem / concept
* however, I still expect you to __write your own code__!

###  Even More Help!

* the readings are _legit_!
	* {{ site.bookq }}
	* [{{site.bookt}}](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/)
* check out the [resources page](../../resources.html)
* stop by my [office hours](../../index.html#contact-info)! (no one ever seems to drop by unless it's before or after an exam)
* get in touch with me [via email](../../index.html#contact-info)
	* it may take one to three days for me to respond
	* (so email me early!)
