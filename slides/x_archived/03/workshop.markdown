###  Workshop Days

__Our next class is our first in-class assignment!__ The focus of class on these workshop days is writing _actual_ code.

* you'll be starting your homework assignment __in class__
* __bring your laptop__
* you can discuss the problem with other students, tutors and me!
* __you'll finish up the homework at home__
* there may be a couple of mini-lectures at the beginning and middle of class to address issues that come up while working on the assignment
