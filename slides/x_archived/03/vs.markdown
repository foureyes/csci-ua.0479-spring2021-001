##  Let's Try Using Both...
* count to 0 to 25 by 5's
	* implement using while
	* implement using for
* print out a series of numbers, each randomly chosen from (1 through 10) that add up to 50 (you can go over)
	* implement using while
	* implement using for

<section markdown="block">
##  For Loops...

__When should you use them? &rarr;__

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
* you know ahead of time how many iterations you'll have to go through
* you have an _iterable_ structure that you have to traverse
	* a sequence of numbers
	* a list of _items_
</div>

<section markdown="block">
##  While Loops

__When should you use them? &rarr;__

<div class="fragment" markdown="block">
* when you don't know how many iterations you'll have to go through!
* when you must repeat something until some condition is met
* generally not a great option for counting (need to keep track of counter separately)
