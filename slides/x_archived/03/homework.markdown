###  Doing the Homework

1. __read the instructions__ in the comments of each file carefully; get in touch with me if there is anything unclear
2. __design your program__:
	* __think__ about how you want to approach the problem before writing any code!
	* write out what steps your program should take in comments
	* use pseudocode / fake code, flow charts, etc.

</section>

###  Doing the Homework Continued

1. write your code outside of the comments (try to preserve the instructions at the top of the file)
2. test your program
3. fix any syntax or logical errors
4. __write your own code__
	* do not copy code from online resources or the book
	* if you worked with someone in class, write their name in a comment at the top of the file
	* (you should still be writing your own code, though!)
</section>

<section markdown="block">
###  Submitting the Homework

* __turn in homework via NYU Classes__
	* upload as attachments to your homework submission
	* keep each file as a separate attachment 
	* there's no need to compress (zip) your files)
* only submit your actual program; you do not need to save and submit your program's output
