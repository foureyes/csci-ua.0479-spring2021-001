## Where Are We?

* first week was supposed to be __control structures__ (like conditionals, loops, etc.)
    * aaand turtle!
    * aaand a little bit about python modules
* this week, we're going to look at __data structures__, specifically _collection_ or _compound_ types 
    * strings, lists, tuples, etc.

## But First, We Missed Some Stuff

__Today, we'll be covering...__ &rarr;

* appoximating pi (more control structures, motivation for turtle)
    * archimedes method
    * monte carlo simulation
* package management (installing modules, virtualenv)

## About the Book

__Some of the assignments and online quizzes rely on readings from the book.__ &rarr;

* I'm basing the readings off of the 2nd edition
* some students have asked if it's ok to use the earlier 1st edition
    * it looks like chapters 1 and 2 are pretty similar
    * the table of contents matches
    * soooo... __it's ok to use the 1st edition__
    * and we'll work through any inconsistencies together

## Homework #01

* __game__ (what time is it? demo time!) 
    * collision detection can be a little off (no problem!)
    * how would you stop the animation animation? stop calling ontimer!
    * the function that you pass to ontimer should not have any arguments
    * (which means, sadly... you'll have to use _a lot_ of globals... maybe)
    * more difficult plz? extra features you can implement for a challenge:
        * score
        * text
        * reset
        * more than 1 rectangle
* __monte carlo simulation__ (we'll take a look again later?)
    * finish up the commented out portions of the program

</section>

## Next Class

You should probably show up to next class (Wednesday 2/3). __We'll be doing an in-class activity__.

* in-class group activity on... list comprehensions, hof, maybe decrypt a message, etc.
* also, we'll _actually_ start up data structures
