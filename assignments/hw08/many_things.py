=====

Create a turtle or processing program that draws multiple objects (with or
without animation) that uses a list of dictionaries to define the properties
of each object in your drawing. 

For example, in the stars exercise in class, we used a dictionary containing
x, y and v as keys that determined a star's position and velocity.
