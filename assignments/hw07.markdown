Draw some stars! 

Requirements
-----

###  Part 1

* customize the colors of your drawing (choose whatever colors you like)
    * change the background color
    * set the pen color
* turn animation off (we're going to be drawing a lot of stars)
* set the width and height to 800 width and 600 height
* create a function called __draw star__
    * you can draw whatever star you like
    * the examples show a typical 5 pointed star
    * parameters: x, y and size
    * processing: it will draw a star at the x and y location specified, and the size of the star; you can take that to mean the size of a side (easier), or the entire star 
    * return: does not return anything
    * don't forget to call update at the end of it
* call your function once to draw a star in the middle of the screen

###  Part 2

* comment out your function call for drawing a single star from the previous part
* now, instead of drawing a single star, draw several stars using a for loop
* they can be drawn in a straight line horizontally or vertically
* or... if you want to get fancy, draw them in a curve
* see the examples below:

###  Part 3

* again, comment out your code for drawing several stars from the previous part
* now, create another function called __generate_star_data__
    * this function will generate a list of lists that represents star data:
        * the first element in the sub list will represent an x value, the second represents a y value, and the last represents size
        * for example, [[0, 0, 10], [200, 200, 80]] represents 2 stars, one at the origin... and a larger star on the upper right hand corner
    * parameters: an int that represents the number of elements in the list (the number stars / sub lists)
    * processing: 
        * it will randomly generate x, y, and size values, put these values into a list... 
        * and add this three element list to the star list (the list of lists)
        * the bounds of the random numbers that you generate can be hard coded based on the width and height of the window
    * return: the list of lists representing stars
* example usage below:

<pre>
star_data = generate_star_data(2)
print(star_data)
#  prints out: [[-250, 121, 49], [100, 0, 20]] 
</pre>

###  Part 4

* use the function from the previous part to generate a list of 40 stars (a list of 40 sub lists)
* save the result of this into a global variable (that is, it should be a variable defined outside of all of your functions)
* create a function called draw_sky:
    * within it, iterate through the global list you created 
    * draw a star based on the data in the sub list (x, y and size)
* call you draw_sky function once...
* it should look something like this:

![lots of stars](http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0002-fall2015-008/resources/img/turtle/starry_4.png)

Optional Challenge!
-----

* within your draw sky function, increment the x value of every sub list by 1 as you iterate through the sub lists to draw stars
* instead of calling your draw_sky function once, use ontimer to have you draw_sky function call itself again in 30 ms
    * call ontimer at the end of your draw_sky function
    * with draw_sky as the first argument (no quotes), and 30 as the second
* you should see an animation!
* now... change your generate_star_data function so that the sub list that creates also contains a 4th value
    * this value represents a velocity
    * it should be small (maybe between 1 and 5)
* in your draw_sky function, as you iterate through your list of star data, add the generated velocity (the value at index 3) to the x value (the value at index 0) rather than just increment by 1
