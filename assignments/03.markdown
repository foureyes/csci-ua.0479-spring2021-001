# Assignment #3 - Summary Statistics and Basic Data Visualization - Due Thu, Feb 20th at 11pm

Clone the homework #3 repository when it is created for you.

## Goals

* work with numpy to calculate summary statistics
* use matplotlib for simple data visualizations

## Requirements

* 1 x notebooks:
	* homework03.ipynb
* 1 x data set:
	* include in repository if possible
	* otherwise, link to data set if file size &gt; 100MB


## Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a single notebook, (`ipynb`) that contains documentation and code. There are 6 parts to this assignment:

1. select and document a data set
	* ‚ö†Ô∏è the data should be comma / pipe / tab delimited... or fixed width
	* ‚ö†Ô∏è the data set should have __two numeric columns__
	* include documentation regarding the source of the data
	* include the data set in your repository so that your notebooks can be run by the graders without having to perform any setup (if data set is &gt; 100MB, link to file instead)
2. write some questions that _may_ be answered by using summary statistics on numeric columns in your data set, or by viewing visualizations
3. calculate summary statistics on both columns using numpy
4. validate calculations using a spreadsheet (such as LibreOffice, Google Sheets, Excel, etc.)
5. create at least two visualizations with matplotlib
6. write a conclusion answering your questions in part 2 based on the results in parts 3 and 4
	* describe the results of your calculations and visualizations
	* describe whether or not they were able to answer your questions from part 2


## Part 1 - Selecting a Data Set, Adding Documentation


#### Find a data set that you'd like to work with

Find a data set that you're interested in... that's publicly available online as a text file (csv, for example). Download your data from a source that has some information regarding the provenance of the data (_where did it come from!?_). Check out some [sources here](../data-sets.html). Some guidelines:

1. do not using the following data sets, because, uh... we probably already wrote (or will write) some code for it üôÉ
	* data sets used in class, like [Nutrition facts for Starbucks Menu](https://www.kaggle.com/starbucks/starbucks-menu)	
	* [The Ultimate Halloween Candy Power Ranking](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking)
	* [Animal Bites](https://www.kaggle.com/rtatman/animal-bites)
	* [IMDB Horror Movie Dataset 2012 Onwards](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/imdb-horror-movie-dataset)
2. <span class="hl">write code that's different from  - or build significantly on - the programs that we've done in class</span> (it's not adequate to simply use class sample code with a different data set üôÖ)

#### Write some documentation 

1. Start a notebook called `homework03.ipynb`
2. Use the markdown below as a template to describe your data
3. Fill in the parts marked as "TODO"


```
# Homework 01

## About the Data

1. Name: (TODO: name of data set)
2. Link to Data: (TODO: link to any documentation about the data that you've found )
3. Source / Origin: (TODO:  discuss the origin of the data (what is it, who collected / generated it, how did they do it, etc.)
4. Motivation: (TODO: describe why you are interested in it) 

```


#### Show Some Data and Document its Format

1. with code, display the first few lines of the file (simply use `open` to do this)
2. describe the format of the data in a markdown cell
	* what are the fields / column headers?
	* what is the _likely_ data type for each column (you can use regular python types or numpy types) of each field

Again, if the data does not have at least two numeric columns, please work with a different data set


## Part 2 - Questions

Write some questions about your data. Focus on the following:

* questions that _may_ be answered by using summary statistics on numeric columns in your data set
* questions that _may_ be answered by viewing basic data visualizations, such as bar charts and scatter plots

## Part 3 - Descriptive Statistics

1. read the data from at least two columns of your file; try to read the numeric data into a numpy array 
	* you can read the individual columns into separate arrays
	* ...or you can read all of the data as a multidimensional numpy array
	* you'll have to parse the data into a numeric type 
	* you may have to clean up the data before it can be converted into a numeric type... for example: 
		* removing leadin / trailing whitespace
		* replacing commas 
		* removing dollar signs
		* deal with missing data
		* etc.
2. calculate the following descriptive statistics on these two columns
	1. examine outliers with min and/or max
	2. measure central tendency by calculating the following:
		* mean
		* median or percentile (quantile), 
	3. measure dispersion with 
		* variance
		* standard deviation (likely of the sample rather than population)
		* interquartile range

## Part 4 - Confirm Calculations

* try opening your original file with LibreOffice, Google Sheets, etc. 
* using your spreadsheet's functions, confirm that your summary statistics match
* in a markdown cell in your notebook:
	* compare and contrast the results from you calculations with numpy... to the results from your spreadsheet
	* investigate any discrepancies, and - if possible - describe (or hypothesize) why there are differences 

## Part 5 - Visualizations

Create at least two visualizations with matplotlib.

## Part 6 - Conclusion

Write a conclusion answering your questions in part 2 based on the results in parts 3 and 4.

* describe the results of your calculations and visualizations
* describe whether or not they were able to answer your questions from part 2
