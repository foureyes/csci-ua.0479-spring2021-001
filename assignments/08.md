# Assignment #8 - Due Monday, April 26th at 11pm


In this homework, you'll:

1. Use conditionals, date and string functions, and
2. Create views, functions, and indexes
3. Connect to a PostgreSQL server by using SQLAlchemy

## Eateries (SQLAlchemy, Date Arithmetic, Functions, Indexes)

### Preparation

Download the __JSON__ file containing a directory of eateries in NYC parks from 2018 from [the data's homepage at NYC Open Data](
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Recreation/Directory-of-Eateries/8792-ebcp)

* read [through the data dictionary](https://www.nycgovparks.org/bigapps/desc/DPR_Eateries_001.txt) to determine the fields
* view the JSON file in a text editor and note the property names
* ⚠️ although several eateries show up with the same name (and consequently, are likely the same actual cart or snack bar), you can treat each json object (and eventually each row in the table) as a distinct eatery)

### DDL

In `src/create_eateries.sql`, write SQL statements to create a table that stores the data from the json file

* start your .sql file with `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS eatery`
* add a `CREATE TABLE eatery` statement...
* accommodate every field in the JSON file
* limit the field types to `text` and `date`
* add a surrogate key, `eatery_id`, as the primary key 
* run your sql in `src/create_eateries.sql` by using any method you like (for example, psql with `\i` or using DataGrip or PgAdmin)

### Python Prep


In `src/db.py`, create functions and a class. The functions will be for reading a config file (that contains your database credentials) and creating sessions and connections. Add a config file, but __do not include it in version control__ called `src/config.json` (place it the `src` directory for easier use with relative paths)

* create a file in `src` called `config.json` (⚠️ do not add this file to git!)
* it should contain the following keys and values:
	```
{
	"username": "yourusername",
	"password": "yourdatabase",
	"database": "hw08"
}
```
* create a function called `generate_dsn` that takes one argument: a single string, the path to a config file
	* it should return a string in the format of:
	* `postgresql://{yourusername}:{yourpassword}@localhost/{database}`
* create a function called `get_session` that takes one argument: a single string, the dsn (the data source name, or the string used to connect to your database)
	* it should return a SQLAlchemy session, [see the slides on sessionmaker and session](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#13), and check out [the example code](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#23) (ignore `declarative base` for now)
* create a class that represents an eatery
	* [see the slides on creating classes that map to tables](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#5); read up to the slide on [columns](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#11)
	* name the class `Eatery`
	* it should include all fields from your create statement, with the appropriate SQLAlchemy type
	* the surrogate key, `report_id`, can be defined as an `Integer`
	* here's an example: [imports](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#22) (please bring in `Date` rather than `DateTime`), and a [class definition](../slides/py-db/sql-alchemy-relationships.html#24)

### Adding Eateries to the Database

In `src/load_eateries.py`, read and parse the json file. Please use relative paths, as if the file were running from the `src` directory.

* `import` your `db` module
* create a dsn using one of your module's functions
* create a `session` using one of your module's functions
* loop through your json data, and instantiate a new eatery using your class... and save each eatery into a list
* use the `session` method, [`add_all`](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14/orm/session_api.html#sqlalchemy.orm.Session.add_all) to add all instances
* make sure to `commit` afterwards
* run your Python script and verify that data has been loaded

### Eatery Queries

In `src/eatery_queries.sql`, write queries based on the questions below.

* write the query or queries you would use to answer the questions
* in a comment below the query, write the first few lines of output of your query

Questions

1. What is the average permit duration? Which eatery has the longest permit?
	* write a function to calculate the permit duration in years as `numeric` by using a `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` statement [see the sample sql file](../sql/design/functions-views.sql), no rounding required
	* use the function in a query to calculate the average duration of permits
	* use the function in a query to display the name and permit number of the eatery with the longest permit __without using LIMIT__ (that is, use a subquery)
2. What is the count of eateries per year based on permit start date?
	* show the year and number of eateries in the dataset for that year, based on start date
	* sort by the year ascending
3. What are the names and eatery types of every eatery in the dataset?
	* break apart the data into two separate tables:
		* instead of a single `eatery_table`, move out `type_name` into its own table
		* call this new table `eatery_type`
		* it should only have two columns: a surrogate key, `eatery_type_id`... and `name`
		* the original `eatery` table should reference theh rows in this new table by using a foreign key
	* write a `CREATE` statement that creates the `eatery_type` table
	* using an `INSERT` statement with a subquery, add rows to the `eatery_type` table based on the distinct values of the `type_name` column in the `eatery` table
	* use an `ALTER` table statement to add a new foreign key column to `eatery` called `eatery_type_id` that references the primary key of the `eatery_type` table ([see the Examples in the postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#id-1.9.3.35.8))
	* write an `UPDATE` statement to populate the foreign key in `eatery`, but do this using an `UPDATE` with a `FROM` clause... that essentially results in a join ([see the notes section in the postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-update.html#id-1.9.3.182.8) [as well as a stackoverlow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7869611))
		```
UPDATE table1 as t
SET col = other_col
FROM table2          -- join with this table
WHERE fk = pk
```
	* use an `ALTER TABLE` statement to remove the `type_name` column from `eatery` so that the type only lives in the referenced table, `eatery_type`... and only the fk exists in `eatery`
	* finally, write a `SELECT` statement to test out your two tables; show the name and type of every eatery by using a join
4. Which eateries are a cart, and which eateries aren't a cart?
	* using the two tables created from the previous part, show every eatery
	* show the eatery's: `eatery_id`, `name`, `permit_number` ... and whether or not it's a cart (look up the type name in the referenced table, `eatery_type`, and if it has the word `cart` as a case insensitive substring, use the value `Cart`, otherwise, use the value in the column)
	* for example, instead of of `Specialty Cart` or `Food Cart`, show `Cart`... but for `Snack Bar` or `Restaurant`, leave the value as is
	* to do this use one of the [conditional expressions in the slides](../slides/db/conditionals.html)
	* the results will only include the following eatery type names: `Cart`, `Restaurant`, `Snack Bar`, and `Mobile Food Truck`
5. Can this be easier / how many are carts, and how many are every other type?
	* imagine trying to group by whether or not an eatery is a cart... that would require rewriting the conditional!
	* to avoid this, capture the result of the query in a view
	* write a query to make a view out of the previous statement; name the view `eatery_report`
	* write a second query that counts the number of each eatery type... but count every type with the word `Cart` in it simply as `Cart`... the results may look _like_:
		```
Restaurant        |    14
Cart              |    98
Snack Bar         |    28
Mobile Food Truck |    97
```
6. How many eateries are there per borough?
	* reread the data dictionary
	* following the same pattern as the previous two questions write a series of SQL statements / queries that eventually shows each borough and the number of eateries per borough
7. Can this be faster?
	* Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to show how much time it takes to search for every eatery named `Pushcart`
	* Add an index to make your query run faster
	* Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` again; there should be a very minor improvement in time
	* Notice that an `Index Scan` is used in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`
	* Write a 3rd query, a `SELECT` statement that involves `name` in the `WHERE` clause, that will cause the query planner to do a sequential scan (that is, try to formulate a query that will make it __not__ use the index)

### Extra Credit

Show some visualization in matplotlib using the data in your `eatery` (and optionally `eatery_type`) table(s). Do this by:

* do this in a notebook called `src/extra_credit.ipynb`
* using Python and either `pscopg2` or `sqlalchemy` connect to the data in the database
* reuse your config file to make this connection / session
* bring in _some_ database data and use that as the basis for your chart or graph
	* for example, use some of the queries in the questions above
	* a bar chart would work for number of eateries grouped by permit start date year
	* ... or a bar chart comparing the eateries per borough
