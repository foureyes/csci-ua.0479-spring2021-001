=====
You've been hired as a grader for several classes, and the total number of 
students you have to grade are over a 1000 (ughhh). Calculating grades by hand for all of those students would drive you INSANE. ... So you create a robot to do it 
for you. A robot in Python. That grades stuff.

And you call it: ~~~GRADE BOT 3K~~~

Your robot will:

1. ask the student for their name
2. greet the student and ask for what class they're in ("Hi ... <student name>, 
   what class are you in?")
3. ask the student how much tests are worth in the class
4. ask for 2 test scores
5. calculate the average for tests and print it out (keep 2 decimal places and
   add a percent sign)
6. ask the student how much homework is worth in the class
7. ask for 2 homework scores
8. calculate the average for homework and print it out (keep 2 decimal places and
   add a percent sign)
9. calculate their final grade based on the weights provided and output it (again
   keep 2 decimals, use a percent sign, and mention the class name)
