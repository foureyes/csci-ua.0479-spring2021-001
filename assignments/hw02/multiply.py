* asks the user for a number
* prints out a table of that number multiplied by the first 7 prime numbers:  
  2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17
* it will format the output so that the original number and the prime number are
  left aligned
* the product is right aligned
  * when using format, don't change the width to align the product
  * keep the width constant
* __COMMENT YOUR SOURCE CODE__ by 
   * briefly describing parts of your program
