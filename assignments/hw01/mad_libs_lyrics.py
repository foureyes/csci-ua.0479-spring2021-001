=====
* find lyrics to one of your favorite songs - about 4 or 5 lines worth of 
  lyrics
* print out each line so that it's outputted to the shell/console
* however, in place of 4 words in your lyrics, use variable names instead
  (see the slides on string concatenation and variables) 
* these words must not be consecutive words (for example, if your lyrics
  were "happy birthday to you", if you choose "happy" as a word to substitute
  with a variable, your next variable cannot be "birthday"
* set your variables equal to strings of your choosing at the top of the file
* name the variables after the part of speech of the word they are replacing, 
  followed by a number:

  verb1 = 'strum'
  adjective1 = 'tiny'
  adjective2 = 'magical'
  noun1 = 'ukulele'
