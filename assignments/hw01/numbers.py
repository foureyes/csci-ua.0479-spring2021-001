ones places of a number.

2. Calculate the numbers in the thousands, hundreds, tens and ones places
3. Output each place
4. One soution is to use some numeric operators to determine each place 
   (maybe % and // may help)
5. You may have to calculate each place separately
6. Don't worry about input that's not a positive whole number below 10,000
