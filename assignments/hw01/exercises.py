7. You look at the clock and it is exactly 2pm. You set an alarm to go off in 
   51 hours. At what time does the alarm go off? (Hint: you could count on 
   your fingers, but this is not what weâ€™re after. If you are tempted to count
   on your fingers, change the 51 to 5100.) 

   * Use an expression consisting of Python values and operators
   * Use a 24 hour clock ... so start off by thinking of 2pm as 14 (no need
     to add am or pm)  
   * Hint: consider using modulo
