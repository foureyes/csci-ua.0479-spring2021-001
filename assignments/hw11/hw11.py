Now that you've learned how to install external Python modules / packages,
you can start looking for modules that are:

* relevant to your area of study
* useful for a project that you're working on
* ...or just interesting / fun to use!

One good resource for this is using Python's Package Index (pypi). There's
a "pre-production" version of a web site that provides an easy search
interface to pypi: https://pypi.org/

For this homework:

1. Search for an interesting Python package or two!
    * use your favorite search engine, pypi.org, or your editor's package 
      manager 
    * do some background research on the project:
        1. is it currently being developed and has it been around for a 
           while? (that is, are there recent updates to it... and has it
           existed long enough to be stable and practical for the community?)
        2. you can see the release history of a package in pypi.org... for
           example, for a package like nltk, pypi.org/project/nltk/#history
           shows that it's been around for many years AND has had recent 
           updates
2. Look for tutorials / documentation on how to use the package or packages
   that you're interested in
3. Download and install the package(s) using PyCharm (or your editor / tool 
   of choice)
4. Try using the package(s) in a small example program to just to prove that
   it was installed correctly and works (this can be as simple as modifying
   sample code or tutorials)
5. List the packages, one per line, in the requirements.txt file included
   in the links to the homework
6. Document the following in this comment block, underneath the line of ='s
    * list out the package or packages you're using as links to the package 
      page on pypi.org
    * discuss why are you interested in the package(s)
    * explain how they are relevant to your area of study or research
    * is/are they: recently updated, been around for a long time, popular?
    * list out the links to tutorials or documentation that you used to
      write your sample / demo code
