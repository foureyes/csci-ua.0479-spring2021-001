# Part 1 (1 point)
# =======
# Create two strings, "123" and "\n  marshmallows\n  ", assign them to the
# variables, numbers and food, respectively (keep ths spaces and new lines).


# Use the method that gives back the uppercase version of a string on your
# variable food. Save the result into a variable named result. Print out both
# variables, result and food.


# Part 2 (1 point)
# =======
# Print out the results of calling the methods that do the following:
# * tests if your numbers variable consists of only digits
# * tests if your numbers variable consists of only letters
# * tests if your numbers variable is uppercase (should be false!)
# * tests if your food variable is lowercase


# Part 3 (1 point)
# =======
# Use the method that gives back the index of a substring from within a
# a larger string to print out the following:
# * call the method to get the index of "mall" in the variable, food... and
#   print out the result
# * call the method again to get the index of "camping" in the variable, food
#   (this should still give back a value, -1!)... and print out the result
#
# Finally use the operator that gives back a boolean if a substring occurs
# within another. Do this to find out of the string "4" is in your string
# variable, numbers.


# Part 4 (1 point)
# =======
# * print out the result of calling the method that removes white space
#   from the beginning and end of your variable, food
# * print out the result of calling the format method on the string,
#   "{0} agitated ants and {1} anxious antelopes" ... and using the numbers
#   24 and 48 as the variables that get placed inot the placeholders
